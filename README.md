# Cows-and-Bulls

A simple word game wherein one person chooses a five letter word and the other guesses it.<br/> The person choosing the word is your computer in this case and you do the intelligent work trying to figure it out using the information that unfolds.<br/>
You are given 10 tries to find out the correct word. For every guess you are provided with a number of cows and bulls.<br/>
* Cows mean the number of letters that are present in your guess as well as the chosen word but dont occupy the same places.<br/> 
Eg. Chosen word is PAINT. You guess ROPES. Then you get cows = 1 as P appears in both but not at same place.
* Bulls mean the number of letters that are present in your guess as well as the chosen word and also occupy the same places.<br/>
Eg. Chosen word is PAINT. You guess SHUNT. Then you get bulls = 2 as N and T appear in both and at same places.<br/>

The list of words was taken from here : http://www.bestwordlist.com/5letterwords.htm
(Some formatting done to change it into the five.txt file). <br/>
Some of these words are very obscure, so better to remove them or use a list that contains less uncommon words.

Enjoy!
